						<h2>Dog Adoption</h2>

						<p class="post-info">The following have informative purpose only. Please consider contacting some of our partners to learn more about how to adopt a dog.</p>

						<p>
							Adopting a dog comes with numerous advantages, including:
							You’re saving a life. Millions of healthy, adoptable dogs are euthanized every year simply for a lack of a home. When you adopt your pet from a shelter or rescue group, you’re giving a deserving pet a loving home.
							Many adoptable dogs are already trained.
							When you adopt an older pet, you will often get a sense of their personality and temperament. You also already know their full grown size!
							An adoption fee can save you money! Adoption fees often include vaccinations, spay/neutering, microchips and other veterinary costs to help prepare the pet for a new home.

						<h2>7 Ways To Transform Your Relationship With your Dog</h2>
					</header>

						<p class="post-info">Friendly advices on how to become a better dog owner.</p>
					</footer>
					<div>
						<p>It turns out that we’ve been approaching life with dogs upside down. We’ve operated under the assumption that a well-mannered dog is a happy, secure dog. But that’s backwards. In fact, a happy, secure dog becomes a well-mannered dog. We’ve been focusing on what a dog does rather than how a dog feels. When dogs feel secure and loved, problem behaviours are largely eliminated. The need for us to direct our dogs’ actions becomes dramatically reduced.</p>
						<p>#1 Put your relationship first. Dogs, like people, are highly social. For social animals, relationships wield enormous power. If your dog has a great relationship with you, it gives him all the motivation he needs to make you happy. Remember, a good connection is reciprocal, allowing both parties some measure of control. For example, the effects of a reciprocal connection or lack thereof are quite obvious when walking your dog on leash. When one of you is dragging the other, the walk becomes arduous, sometimes even grueling. But when you and your dog are in sync, the walk becomes effortless and enjoyable. The difference is so dramatic that I created a leash that allows you to hold one end while your dog holds the other, giving both a feeling of connection and control. Think of leash-walking as a microcosm of everyday life with your dog. Because dogs must function in our human world, the leadership role falls primarily to us, but that doesn’t mean we should act as dictators. Our greatest influence comes from connection, not direction.</p>
						<p>#2 Seek to understand your dog. In any good relationship, empathetic understanding is critical. Your dog already spends a great deal of time trying to understand you, analyzing your habits, moods, and preferences. Do your dog the same courtesy: learn as much as you can about dogs in general. What colours can they see? How does their amazing sense of smell work? What emotions do they appear to experience? Study your dog to learn as much about him as you can. What does he like to eat? What games does he enjoy? Is he a laid-back couch potato or a high-energy herder? What are his greatest fears? To know is undoubtedly to love—something he likely figured out about you long ago.</p>
						<p>#3 Look with eyes of love. Your perspective determines your response to things that happen. If you believe that your dog gets angry when left alone in the house and seeks revenge by shredding your paper towels, you’re bound to get angry in return. Undoubtedly, you would be more sympathetic if you realized that dogs who do “naughty” things while you are away, such as shredding paper towels, are likely doing so as a way of coping with the fact that they miss you. Remember that his very life depends upon you taking care of him. He would never do anything just to anger or frustrate you. If he does upset you, do all in your power to see the situation through his eyes, those same eyes that view you with such adoration. </p>
						<p>#4 Help your dog learn to trust you. Studies have shown that dogs develop attachment patterns to their primary caregivers similar to those experienced by preverbal children. It is critical that your dog’s attachment to you be a secure one. Dogs who have secure attachments to their people are far less likely to display problem behaviours rooted in anxiety than their less secure counterparts. You can secure your dog’s attachment to you by responding consistently to his needs and never making him feel that he has to earn your love or caring. If he asks for your attention or affection, give it to him. Give him treats as “I love you and will always care for you” gifts rather than as rewards for his compliance to your directives.</p>
						<p>#5 Stop training your dog. Current approaches to training dogs, including positive reinforcement, promote a sense of conditional affection—I love you if you do as I say, or I will feed you when you please me. This is something that can badly damage your dog’s trust in you and in himself, creating a vicious cycle. Damaged trust results in increased anxiety that increases the likelihood of problem behaviours. These problem behaviours may be linked to a desire to secure your connection or caregiving (think mouthing, jumping, and submissive urination), a need to exert greater control over his environment (such as reactivity or stalling on leash), or an effort to cope with stress (such as paper shredding, compulsive chewing or excessive barking). With most training methods, the suggested solutions to these problem behaviours involve increasing your control over your dog, thus starting the cycle again.</p>
						<p>#6 Help your dog learn. Learning can be a social, internally motivated process as happens when a dog discovers that sitting when his person sits helps keep his group in sync and makes his person happy. Internally motivated learning is far better overall for dogs, allowing them to develop a strong bond with their teachers and exert a measure of control over their environment, necessary for mental wellbeing. Internally motivated learning in dogs is also better for us as it requires less vigilance and allows our dogs greater flexibility in understanding what constitutes appropriate behaviour. A dog who knows how to sit when cued requires more direction and management than does a dog who figures out that it is best to be still and quiet when his person is still and quiet. Give your dog the chance to learn to direct his own behaviour by allowing him to watch and synchronize with you and he will do so appropriately the vast majority of the time. And, dogs trusted to self-direct are more likely to comply when you do have to request a particular behaviour.</p>
						<p>#7 Allow Your Dog to Astonish You. Cognition is the acquisition of knowledge and understanding as the result of mental processes such as memory, thought, planning, and perception. Thanks to the many canine cognition centers now open at prestigious universities worldwide, we know that dogs are capable of relatively complex cognition. Can your dog learn to answer yes or no questions? Can he distinguish between yellow and blue? Can he copy your actions when asked? Can he sniff out a treat or toy you’ve hidden? Ask him. Teach him that touching your left hand indicates yes and your right hand indicates no. Show him something in yellow as you say, “yellow” and likewise with blue. Demonstrate a simple action and ask your dog to do like me. Hide his kibble or toys around the house or fenced yard and allow him to follow his nose. We’ve been so focused on telling our dogs what to do that we’ve forgotten to ask them what they are capable of doing. The answer may well astonish you!</p>
						<p>Living with and loving dogs can and should be a pleasure. There is certainly no need for fear, force, or conditional affection. All of those are counterproductive to what is most essential: your relationship with your dog. And as in any relationship, the bond is the key element. The way to achieve a bond beyond measure is quite simple: love is all you need!

				<h2>Dogs Are Even More Like Us Than We Thought</h2>
				<p>
					It's likely no surprise to dog owners, but growing research suggests that man's best friend often acts more human than canine.   
					Dogs can read facial expressions, communicate jealousy, display empathy, and even watch TV, studies have shown. They've picked up these people-like traits during their evolution from wolves to domesticated pets, which occurred between 11,000 and 16,000 years ago, experts say.
					In particular, "paying attention to us, getting along with us, [and] tolerating us" has led to particular characteristics that often mirror ours, says Laurie Santos, director of the Yale Comparative Cognition Laboratory.

				<h2>Eavesdropping Dogs</h2>
				<p>
					Social eavesdropping—or people-watching—is central to human social interactions, since it allows us to figure out who's nice and who's mean.
					According to a study published in August in the journal Animal Behaviour, our dogs listen in too.
					In a new study, scientists tested 54 dogs that each watched their owners struggle to retrieve a roll of tape from a container. The dogs were divided into three groups: helper, non-helper, and control.
					In the helper group, the owner requested help from another person, who held the container. In the non-helper group, the owner asked for help from a person, who then turned their back without helping. In the control group, the additional person turned his or her back without being asked for help. In all experiments, a third, "neutral" person sat in the room.
					After the first round of experiments, the neutral person and the helper or non-helper both offered treats to the dog.
					In the non-helper group, canines most frequently favored the neutral person's treat, shunning the non-helper. However, in the helper group, the dogs did not favor either the helper or the neutral person over the other. Scientists have previously observed similar results in human infants and tufted capuchin monkeys.
					So are dogs taking sides by ignoring the people who are mean to their owners? Only future research will tell.

				<h2>Next Steps in Dog Research</h2>
				<p>
					In humans, aging hastens declines in short-term memory and logical reasoning skills, making it more difficult to learn new tasks. Previous research has found similar declines in dogs, but long-term memory is a little-known aspect of dog biology.
					That's why Wallis and colleagues are studying how dogs both young and old memorize tasks, and whether the animals can remember them months later.
					The results are still in the works, but Wallis expects to discover that it's tough—but not impossible—to teach old dogs new tricks.
